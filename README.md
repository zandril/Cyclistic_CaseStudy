# Cyclistic_CaseStudy
Introduction
In this case study a fictional bike-share company based out of Chicago called “Cyclistic” is looking to produce more annual memberships. To do this we must understand how casual riders and annual members use the bike-share differently. The goal from these insights is to design an innovative marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. For this to be successful we must back up our recommendation with data insights and visualizations.
I will be looking at data for a company named Cyclistic which runs a bike sharing program in the Chicago area. The program currently has 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations located around the city. The company has looked at its financial data and has determined that annual memberships are more profitable than casual riders. They are now looking to focus on converting casual riders to members.
For the company to do this we first need a better understanding of how the usage of the two groups compare. We will look for similarities and more importantly differences so that we can create a campaign to target casual riders.
The data provided to use can be found here we will be looking at the data from 2022 in its entirety to see how trends change over the course of the year. The data contains a few fields where each ride started, ended, the time the ride started and the time the ride ended as well as the stations the ride started and ended at.
Process
First we loaded the data into Excel to quickly look through and find issues with the data that we can fix now before adding the dataset to a SQL database. We cleared out rows that were missing information or if we could find that information and fill in the blanks.
We also checked formatting to make sure data input correctly. We did this via filters and cell formatting and using Trim to remove and spaces that could cause issues. After this the data added into BigQuery, Googles SQL platform based in the cloud.
Below you can see the different fields available to be used in the analysis process.
